    use vendor\phpoffice\PhpSpreadsheet\src\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory;
    use vendor\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\src\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Xlsx;

    $spreadsheet = PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory::load("Blanksheet/blank_pffile.xlsx");
    $spreadsheet->setActiveSheetIndex(0);
my end code is

    $xlsFile = 'temp.xlsx';
    ob_clean();
    header('Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet');
    header("Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=$xlsFile");
    header('Cache-Control: max-age=0');

    $objWriter = IOFactory::createWriter($spreadsheet, $xlsFile);
    $objWriter->save('php://output');
